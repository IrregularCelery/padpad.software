Sandbox `serial-transceiver`
    [x] Combine both 'read' and 'write' threads because 'write' thread is no longer needed.

[x] Ensure there's only one instance of the application running
    - A lock file could work, but the problem is, if the app crashed or was force-closed,
        next time, you cannot open the app. because the file couldn't get destroyed on app exit.
    âœ” Checking for the TCP address, could be a good way too... if the address/port is in use,
        throw an error.
[] Add `confirm_exit` functionality to `Dashboard` app
[] Add "xdg-open" is needed to README.md (open)
[] Add "xdotool" is needed to README.md (enigo)

Dashboard
    [] Maybe! a robust system to auto-detect all the components from the device and add them
        to layout. (No promises! :D)
    [] Add ability to upload bitmaps from the dashboard to device for "Screen Saver"
        - Only have it when the device and software are paired/connected
        - Save it to devive's memory

Firmware
    [x] Ground all cd4051be channels to reduce cross-talk and noise
    [x] Map pot values to 0-255 (mapped to 0-99 instead)
    [x] EEPROM/FLASH
        [x] Make EEPROM-saved keyboard keys/letters usable even if the device wasn't paired
    [x] Pot handling
    [] Diplay
    [x] Rotary encoder
    [x] Joystick/Thumbstick
        [] Add the ability to scroll with the `joystick` if the modkey was `held`

Optional
    [] Date/Time formatting for logging system
